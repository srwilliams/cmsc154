Question 3 points and comments: 11/15
L_BJ*F_BJ and (1-r)*M+H*R terms should be summed not added
one is related to latency for branches and jumps, the other for memory loads and stores
also, to properly account for the part of the average latency from loads and stores,
you need to multiply that term by the sum of the percentage of instructions that are loads and stores
