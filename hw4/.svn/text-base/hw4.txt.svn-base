C = 512
S = 32
E = 1
B = 16

A. 100%
B. 25%
C. 25%
D. No, because the full size of the array fits in the cache, and the initial miss rate is a result of the empty cache.
E. Yes, because the cache would load more of each part of the array in each block, and cut down on the number of times it would have to query the main memory for part of the array. It would exploit more spatial locality.  However, it would increase the miss penalty.

A. L_AL * (1 - F_LD + F_ST + F_BJ) + (L_BJ * F_BJ) * ((1-R) * M + (H * R))
B. 1.1 *(1 - .22 + .12 + .20) + (3 * .20) * ((1 - .6) * 120 + (1 * .6)) = 30.37
