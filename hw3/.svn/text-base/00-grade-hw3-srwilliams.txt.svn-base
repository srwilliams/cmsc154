Question 2 points and comments: 8.5/12
A: x is in %esi, n is in %ecx, result is in %eax, and mask is in %edx. -2
B: result = 0. -1
E: Rather, result |= (x & mask), not (x & n). -0.5

To break it down further (line number in brackets [#]):

The value of the stack pointer %esp is moved into %ebp. [3]
Note that arguments to functions are usually stored relative to the stack pointer.
We move 8(%ebp) into %esi - this is the first argument to the function, x. [10]
We move 12(%ebp) into %ecx - this is the second argument to the function, n. [9]
%eax is the return value of functions - since we return "result" at the end
of our function, we know reuslt is held in %eax.
%eax = (%eax ^ %eax), aka %eax = 0 as anything xor'd with itself is 0.
So result = 0 initially. [7]
This leaves %edx = 3, which we can conclude holds mask, which is set to 3. [8]

Now we loop: [12-18]
Recall that %eax holds result at the top of each iteration of the loop.
%edi now holds result (this is for temporary storage). [12]
%eax now holds mask. [13]
%eax = %eax & %esi (%eax = mask & x). [14]
%eax = %eax | %edi (%eax = (mask & x) | result). [15]
This is the final value held in %eax before the eventual return, so we know
that result = (mask & x) | result.

We shift %edx left by %cl bytes (we shift mask left by n bytes). [16]
This is the update for every byte.

We test to see if %edx = 0 (mask = 0). [17]
We loop again if mask != 0. [18]
So our loop test is mask != 0.

We have the following function in the end:

int loop (int x, int n) {
  int result = 0;
  int mask;
  for (mask = 3; mask != 0; mask = mask << n) {
    result = result | (x & mask);
  }
  return result;
}

Sorry for how long this was. Hope that helps you understand!
